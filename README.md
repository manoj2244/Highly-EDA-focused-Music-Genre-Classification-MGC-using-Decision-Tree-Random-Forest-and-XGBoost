# Highly-EDA-focused-Music-Genre-Classification-MGC-using-Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-and-XGBoost.

This project is highly focused on Exploratory Data Analysis part for of the Machine learning work flow. MGC dataset from the kaggle which was primarily taken from the Spotify Music. We applied the traditional ML algorithms like Decision Tree with max depth limitation, Random Forest, XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning using MLFlow.

In this project, we explore the effectiveness of various classification algorithms for the task of music genre classification (MGC) using a publicly available dataset on kaggle.The objective is to identify the most accurate and efficient algorithm for MGC tasks. We begin by preprocessing and cleaning the data to ensure its quality and relevance. Next, we use multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random forest (RF), Decision Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoosting), to classify the music genre of the dataset. We use hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the performance of the best algorithm identified. We evaluate the performance of each algorithm based on standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as our labels of the target class are balanced. Furthermore, we perform a comparative analysis of the algorithms to identify the best-performing algorithm for MGC tasks. Our results indicate that Decision Tree with max depth control and Random Forest algorithms perform the best among all the algorithms tested, with an accuracy of around 82%. Overall, this project highlights the importance of selecting the right classification algorithm for MGC tasks and provides useful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms.
